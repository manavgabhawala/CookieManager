/// A HTTPCookie instance represents a single http cookie. It is an object initialized from a NSHTTPCookie that contains the various cookie attributes or for newer versions using the exact values of the cookies from the binary file. It has accessors and setters to get the various attributes of a cookie. It also has an update method to update the cookie's details.
struct HTTPCookie
{
	/// Returns the domain of the receiver. This value specifies URL domain to which the cookie should be sent. A domain with a leading dot means the cookie should be sent to subdomains as well, assuming certain other restrictions are valid. See RFC 2965 for more detail.

	/// Whether the receiver should only be sent to HTTP servers per RFC 2965. Cookies may be marked as HTTPOnly by a server (or by a javascript). Cookies marked as such must only be sent via HTTP Headers in HTTP Requests for URL's that match both the path and domain of the respective Cookies. Specifically these cookies should not be delivered to any javascript applications to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. `true` if this cookie should only be sent via HTTP headers, `false` otherwise.
	var HTTPOnly: Bool
	
	/// Returns whether the receiver should be sent only over secure channels. Cookies may be marked secure by a server (or by a javascript). Cookies marked as such must only be sent via an encrypted connection to 	trusted servers (i.e. via SSL or TLS), and should not be delievered to any javascript applications to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. `true` if this cookie should be sent only over secure channels, `false` otherwise.

	/// Returns the path of the receiver. This value specifies the URL path under the cookie's domain for which this cookie should be sent. The cookie will also be sent for children of that path, so "/" is the most general.
	var path: String
